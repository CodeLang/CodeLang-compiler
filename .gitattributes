# To get better language analysis on github, we will rename certain file extensions to be a different language name.
# The linguist tool github uses to detect this does not allow you to use your own language.
# So we will also pick existing languages.
*.hcp linguist-language=Fancy
*.UniLang inguist-language=Pure Data

# Here are other language names we may want to use in the future.
#
# APL
# Apex
# Apollo Guidance Computer
# Clean
# Common Workflow Language
# Cool
# Easybuild
# Pure Data
# Self
# Smarty
