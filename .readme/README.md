# Documentation Resources
Here is where we place all of the resources related to unilang's documentation.  
These originate and can be edited from lucid chart <TODO: post link>  
We may expand this to generate manuals, online documentation etc.  Maybe pandoc.  
For now, we just target the main Readme.md

consider this casing:  
ᴜɴɪʟᴀɴɢ

If you need to white-trim some images, I've used:  
mogrify -trim *.png
