## Unilang
Unilang is a universal programming language.  
It is the unification of all programming concepts without syntax.  
It is a higher level language above all high level languages.   
It was built to improve the efficiency of the modern software engineer.    

Here are the core principals that guide unilang's development:  

#### 1.  Syntax
Syntax doesn't matter.  It never has, and it never will.    
We eliminate syntax complexity through unique token symbols.  
Unilang pulls from [Unicode's Private Use Area (PUA)][1].  
No matter how many features are added the the language,  lexical/syntax analysis remains trivial.  


### 2. Grammar
You can express anything in any order assuming that it makes sense conceptually.
