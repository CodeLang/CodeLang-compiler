**A universal programming language**

# Introduction
Welcome to the world of Unilang.  We'll start by getting you acquainted with the big picture.  Unilang is a tool for writing software.  Like all tools in software, it takes an input and produces an output.  The scope of unilang's throughput is ambitious.  Everything a software engineer can express around a problem domain should be encoded in the same ontology.  The output of unilang is every chosen artifact that facilitates tasks in that domain.  From a programming language perspective, we unify all of the formal and informal language involved in software development.  This information forms a single abstract model that is used to create various artifacts.

This explanation may appear imprecise.  Consider the transformation process of source code to other languages.  However, the scope of these other languages often don't entail all of the work that needs to be done for software.

Much like other general purpose programming languages (GPLs), Unilang can be used to generate programs for any domain.  A key feature of unilang is that it can target source code of other languages.  In this regard, Unilang will act as a transcompiler to other programming languages.

There are many other types of artifacts that should be created alongside software.  Unilang facilitates the creation of all related artifacts.
