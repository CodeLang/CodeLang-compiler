## Unilang
Unilang is a universal programming language.  
It is the unification of all programming concepts without syntax.  
It is a higher level language above all high level languages.   
It was built to improve the efficiency of the modern software engineer.    

Here are the guiding principals that have contributed to unilang's development.

#### 1.  Syntax
Syntax doesn't matter.  It never has, and it never will.    
We eliminate syntax through unique token symbols.  
This means that the unilang character set is done strictly from unicode.  
We pull from Unicode's Private Use Area (PUA), but don't even worry about that.  

### 2. Grammar
