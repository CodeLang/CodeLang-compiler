# UniLang
UniLang is a universal programming language.  
It is the unification of all programming concepts without syntax.
It is a higher level language above all high level languages. 
It was built to improve the effeciency of the modern software engineer.  

# how is this done?  
 - it uses unique unicode tokens to provide a feature rich textual language while avoiding the complexities of syntax and parsing
 - GUIs are also built on top for projectional editing capability
 - the transcompiler is heavily customizable.

Keep in mind, your opinion of the language doesn't matter because it's not for you.
Unilang will transcompile down into anything.  

Go ahead an circle-jerk about the trivialities you think are important in languages.
Unilang will meet your misguided inexperienced opinions.
