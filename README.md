**A universal programming language**

# Introduction
Welcome to the Unilang language.  We'll start by getting you acquainted with the big picture.  Unilang is a tool for writing software.  Like all tools in software, it takes an input and produces an output.  The scope of unilang's input is ambitiously defined as *everything a software engineer can express for accomplishing a task*.  The output of unilang is defined as *all of the chosen artifacts that facilitate accomplishing that task*.  From a programming language perspective, we unify an encode all of software development into a single abstract model.  This abstract model is used to create various software artifacts.

This explanation may appear imprecise.  Consider the transformation process of source code to other languages.  However, the scope of these other languages often don't entail all of the work that needs to be done for software.

Much like other general purpose programming languages (GPLs), Unilang can be used to generate programs for any domain.  A key feature of unilang is that it can target source code of other languages.  In this regard, Unilang will act as a transcompiler to other programming languages.

Its important to keep in mind, that there are many other types of artifacts that should be created alongside software.  Unilang facilitates the creation of all related artifacts.
