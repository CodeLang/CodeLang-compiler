## UniLang
UniLang is a universal programming language.  
It is the unification of all programming concepts without syntax.  
It is a higher level language above all high level languages.   
It was built to improve the effeciency of the modern software engineer.    

## how is this done?  
It uses unique unicode tokens to provide a feature rich textual language while avoiding the complexities of syntax and parsing.  GUIs can be used for projectional editing.  the transcompiler is heavily customizable.

Keep in mind, your opinion of the language doesn't matter because it's not for you.
Unilang will transcompile down into anything.  

Go ahead an circle-jerk about the trivialities you think are important in languages.
Unilang will meet your misguided inexperienced opinions.
