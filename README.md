# Introduction
Unilang is a programming language that unifies software development practices into a single abstract model.  The model is used to create various software artifacts.

This transformation process will look similar to the source code translations from other languages.

Much like other GPLs, Unilang can be used to generate programs, as well as the source code for these other languages.  In this regard, Unilang can act as a transcompiler to other programming languages.

Its important to keep in mind, that there are many other types of artifacts that should be created alongside software.  Unilang facilitates the creation of all related artifacts.
