# Our CI system will mimic the same build as a normal user.  
# However, do to the limitation of some online CIs (for example: timing out if the build is too long),
# we use this script as the CI frontend.  This way we can change how all the CIs build and test,
# without affecting the user.
# to test simple bazel bootstraping, we could use:
# ./user_build run //code/hello_world/sh:hello_world
set -euo pipefail
./build_everything
