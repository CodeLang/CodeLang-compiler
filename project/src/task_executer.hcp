//things that are dumb, that code generation will fix:
//- having to write two files for global code (only one file now)
//- having to write two/three files for object code (only one file now)

//-repetitions that are no longer an issue:
// - source files automatically include their corresponding header files, with a header comment
// - no need to write both function decelerations and definitions.
// - no need to match the parameter name for doxygen comments
// - no need to figure out what the include guards are, and no need to type them.
// - no need to type the giant doxugen comment block header thing we use.

//dealing with boilerplate code:
//  - hard to keep consistent across files (generated automatically now)
//  - structs having that unnecessary extra name
//    (doesn't matter now.  All the structs you need are generated 
//    automatically based on member variables,functions, and the file name)
//hungarian notation is terrible.  This softens the blow, as the correct notation can be generated and met at the function signature level.
//Since you shouldn't be writing any code outside of functions, this analogous to static enforcement by the compiler.
//make a better write up later...
