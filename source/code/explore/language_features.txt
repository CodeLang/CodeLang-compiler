Various language features and code generation ideas to support:

- Option to make function result cached
this could turn a regular function into a function that holds the result as a static.
It may also create an additional function so that there is a cached / noncached version.

- Tag portions of unilang structure as "generated" or "not generated".
Based on options an code generation, we are going to be changing the actual unilang structure pragmatically.
adding methods to the methods section. Adding data members to objects. All kinds of things.
All of this data needs an enum for SPECIFIED/GENERATED. in accordance to what is contained in the actual .UniLang file.
We may also accomplish this at the graphical level with an additional label face that holds this property.
