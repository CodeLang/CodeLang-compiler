Unilang TODOs:

json fixer for schema changes (currently breaks loading on old files; need a way to upgrade)
generate unilang docs with GUI
undo/redo- requires tracking every change on the tree, and finding out what the reverse is later
allow moving elements in the tree (based on the schema) (shifting elements with keystrokes) (dragging elements with mouse)

leaving notes for yourself on the doc:
	- tree should allow "disabling" elements.  
        This will disable all elements recursively on the chosen node which is skipped during tokenization

	- standalone box drawing (eventually go all out, and allow glify dia style shape drawing)

	- highlight text and leave a note on that text like in microsoft word


Make things have a z-index
Make things draggable
This will need enforced by having unified methods up the graphic object composition
