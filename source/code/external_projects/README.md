This is where we write Unilang for external projects that do not have unilang tooling as part of their own build system.
We write a mirrored version of a repository here in UniLang, and then there is a transfer process.  
It converts UniLang to the company/community's repository.  

Clearly UniLang code will need to interact/reference non-UniLang code as well.  
That can become a gray area and dead end for certain analysis, but its necessary as I'm injecting UniLang artifacts into other code bases.  

What if somebody changes code that was generated by UniLang?  
Again, for the time being that is a manual process of updating UniLang code.  
Seeing these changes are usually for the better though, as it helps us adapt UniLang to the needs of others.

Summary:
The directories here mirror the Desktop directories of non-unilang codebases that exist either on or off the same machine.  
We write our unilang code in these directories and they are transcompiled and transferred onto the repo (possibly over the network).  
We do this because we want to keep the UniLang files in our codebase, and avoid generated artifacts then deal with gitignoring them somehow.
