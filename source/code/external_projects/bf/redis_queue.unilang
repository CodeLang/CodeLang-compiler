􏷲a redis queue􏷱
􏷰a redis queue is an implementation of a queue data structure which internally uses a redis cluster to distribute the data across shards.
Its important to know that the lifetime of the queue persists before and after the queue data structure is created (since it exists in redis)
Therefore, two shard queues with the same name, would in fact be the same underlying redis queue􏷯
