􏷲a shard queue􏷱
􏷰a shard queue is an implementation of a queue data structure which internally uses a redis cluster to distribute the data across shards.
Its important to know that the lifetime of the queue data persists before and after the queue data structure is created (since it exists in redis)􏷯
