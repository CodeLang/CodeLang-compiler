Here is where we test the unilang transcompiler from within the build itself.
Using the unilang-toolchain, we convert unilang code down into other languages.
Then we run the specific language toolchains as necessary.
This is all done from inside specific unilang bazel build rules.

These bazel tests have been auto-generated by the 'bazel refresh' tool.
Do not change them directly.
