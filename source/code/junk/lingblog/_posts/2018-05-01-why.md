title:  "Why Linguistics?"
---

From the grinding gears of the first calculator, a lingering breathe was born to veer its teeth in the whispers of innovation.
Where in each crank, I was bit deeper into an already stiffening neck.
Only now have I decided to turn myself in counterbalance.
When the threshold passed, my destiny became providential.
It's arrival felt unexpected at first, yet in sustainment of my values, inevitable.
Becoming a linguist is now my only path forward.
I had to do something, and I've chosen to run.
But I'm not running away from the problem.
I'm running toward the solution.
I'll be back.
And when I am, I'll turn the gears for you once more.

The software industry is in a crisis not defined through its apparency.
Particular trends change slowly and quietly over time.
The ignorance of a problem may result in bliss, but having bliss does not solve the problem.
If a problem becomes too commonplace, people accept it.

People has accepted bad software.
The word "bug" is a household word.
We power cycle our routers daily.
Security doesn't work. Nobody really believes their data is protected- nor should they.
Operating systems crash.  Programs crash.  Planes crash.  Autonomous vehicles manslaughter.
Billions of dollars get poured into millions of people staring at screens wondering why things fail to work.

Those in the industry witness prior symptoms.
Software brings with it, a slew of familiar properties.
Inefficient.  Over budget.
Poor quality. Doesn't meet requirements.
Burdensome to maintain.  Challenging to measure. Hard to test.  Harder to understand.
Needs rewritten.  Out of time.  Not delivered.  Product delayed.  Repeat.
These are not enginering surprises.
They have been expectations.

The future is not however doom-laden.
Being in a crisis doesn't mean we're unhappy.
If you were born in a nightmare, there's little I could say to scare you.
We've done so much in such a short amount of time, its only natural that our speed brings with us our shortcomings.
Since software is always getting better, and the affects of software on society are always improving lives, its easy to disregard the legitimacy of the crisis.
This is why a crisis can be prevalent, yet deceptive.
You need to look at the rates.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/crisis-gap.svg" alt="a graph of the crisis gap">
Society is demanding more out of software at a faster rate than the industry can deliver.
To put it another way, the crisis gap, which society has already become desensitized to, is widening.
The wider the gap, the lower the software quality. The lower the quality, the more societal growth will be hindered.

Before we focus on using linguistics to narrow the crisis gap, we'll cover the remaining perspectives around the crisis itself.

The majority of people, primarily outside industry, are unaware that the problem exists.
Other people, primarily in the industry, have accepted the problem yet are unaware of its magnitude.
Next, there are those who recognize the crisis, but believe the undertaking would be either monumental or unfruitful.
Time is money, and the industry has neither the time nor the money to invest in an immeasurable nonimmediate return.
Similarly, the individual often lacks the time and resources necessary.
They decide to move onto more obtainable solutions.
Others have tried to shorten the gap, but have reached the conclusion that it cannot be done.  They surrender to circumstance.
This in turn, becomes an acceptance of the problem.
Those who are working to shorten the gap are still taking the wrong approaches.
We will cover these approaches in more detail later.
Lastly, if you remove pride from the software equation, engineers thrive in the field's complexity.
As long as software engineering remains difficult, engineers can sustain competitiveness in the market.
There's little reason to make improvements to an industry whose complexity results in your high compensation- assuming compensation is the core motivator.
Another unprideful motivator comes from the excitement that complexity brings to the job.
Puzzle solvers enjoy the puzzle, not the solution.
There is a thrill to the Russian roulette of adding more complexity and giddily awaiting the next challenge it brings you.
All of the mindsets discussed here, are in opposition to closing the crisis gap.

For now, we conclude our analysis on the software crisis, and the human behaviors surrounding it.
We will later focus our attention to the root of the problem which manifests within the art of software engineering itself.
A new linguistical foundation will be applied to the core of this discipline.

#### To summarize,
The software industry is unable to meet societal demands.
The improvements made in the software industry occur at a slower rate than societal demands.
This divergence is coined the software crisis, and the author philosophizes its persistence.
Naivet√©, acceptance, ineptitude, futility, neglect, self-preservation, and amusement are why the crisis remains.
The author decides to pursue linguistics in the art of programming under the presumption it will solve the crisis.
