title:  "A Proper Linguist"
---

If your tears are salty, you're less likely to admire the sun.
Once I logged out, I searched above the mist for fluorescence.
Its there I saw a cut unstitched in sky.
The umbrella of linguistics has not kept everyone out of the rain.
There is still a small tear in the subfield of _computational linguistics_.
If you peek through the crack, you'll spot a bunch of wet engineers turning the flood to La Croix.
Harkening for thunder, its why the already dripping stay draped in hoodies.
We build our own umbrellas to stay dry, but the lands turn to marsh and our sneakers start to squish.
Natives tell you tales of their own lost sneakers as they arm the sails to face the brewing storm.
Winds change.
Currents rock.
Waves rise high and crash hard.
Barnacles accumulate along the keel, and krakens pull from below.
Software engineers focus on the boat and the art of sailing in the storm.
Software linguists end the storm.

We need to rebuild software engineering from the ground up.
In particular, we must unify the gap between language and software.
One aspect of accomplishing this involves turning linguistic phenomena into computational models that can be expressed and interacted with.
Software linguistics will pull from many disciplines within linguistics so that it can reconstruct what it means to author, interact, and change software.
We see the correlation between the two sciences and the placement of the new unifying field below.

Software linguistics and its relation to modern programming languages will be discussed later.

As we discuss what it means to be a software linguist, it is important to reiterate on the external factors outside the discipline that impact software engineering's perceived difficulty.
You can blame the company.
You can blame the managers.
You'll most likely blame that one developer, or that one team.
Whatever or whomever you'd like to contribute your failures to, they are not unique explanations to the reoccurring problems.
They happen everywhere in the industry, rendering the problems unoriginal as well.
It takes significant effort to lessen the damaging effect of these external influences.
As we've seen already, the rate of external pressure is insurmountable to the industry's ability to react to it.
These types of cultural, industrial, and interpersonal dilemmas can be categorized under "societal demands" discussed in the previous sections on _the software crisis_.

As software linguists we are not concerned about addressing these issues directly, as they occur at the industry and societal level.
We will however use them to measure our success since we intend to prevent them in the first place.

This puts us in an interesting position as we are now left with a body of social science that we refuse to apply to our social situations.
We apply it instead to the language of software, which as of today, has mistakenly remained unsocial.
A software linguist then, is not concerned about elegant prose or impressing peers with their vivid narratives.
They aren't story tellers, or motivational speech writers.
They don't turn software to poetry, or follow after the software as technical writers.
They certainly aren't grammarians. You'd never see a software linguist tell you not to split infinitives.
A software linguist doesn't have to talk to anyone.
They see language for what it is- a tool to express meaning.
And they see software for what it isn't- the meaning that encoded it.

#### To summarize,
Software linguistics is a new scientific field established under computational linguistics.
The field was constructed to aid in the closing of the software crisis by providing a better foundation for software engineering.
We revisit the software difficulties categorized as societal pressures and acknowledge that they are outside the application of software linguistics.
A proper software linguist is not defined as an enthusiast of language artistry, but a practical utilizer of linguistic phenomena for increasing communicate meaning within the lifecycle of software.
