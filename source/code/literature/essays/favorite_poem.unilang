From the bag
To the floor things fell down.
And I think
That the world
Is only a grin
Glimmering
On the hanged man’s mouth.
Translated by Alexandr Zorin

My bag breaks
and everything falls to the floor.
It occurs to me
the world is a grin that flickers
on a hanged man’s dead face.
Translated by Paul Schmidt
