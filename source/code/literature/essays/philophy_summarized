all philosophical ideas can be encompassed or associated between three categories of thought

these categories are metaphysics, epistemology, and axiology.
metaphysics is the study of ultimate reality
there may be an ultimate reality that remains unpenetrable by the study of our material world for which physics provides our testable hypothesis;
hence the "meta" in our speculation for an immaterial world giving possible credence to the material world

whether the soul exists or consciousness exists outside its material form is a metaphysical claim
the material world exists governed by the rules of logic is a metaphysical claim
episitemology is the study of knowledge meaning what we can know, and what we can't know; as well as the valid and invalid ways of knowing
episotomology the study of how we know what we know
logic is a kind of epistemology
evidence is a kind of epistemology
logic and evidence together is the scientific method

atheism is a metaphysical claim; the claim that god does not exist
agnosticism is an epistemological claim; the claim that we can't know if god exists


axiology is the study of value
this gives rise to subdisciplines such as aesthetics (the study of beauty)
ethics (the study of right and wrong)

metaphysics and epistemology are boolean in their claims
the soul either exists or it does not
a logical statement is either a fallacy or it is not

axiology is built on realitivity and degree





premodernism:
    - start with metaphysical views
    - derive epistemological claims based on metaphysical views
I am, therefore I think

modernism:
    - prioritizes epistemology over metaphysics
    aka, the epistemic shift (aka. the enlightenment)
I think, therefore I am



physics study of the material world
a speculation of an immaterial world explaining a material world and whether clues of an immaterial world could be derived 

physics= true of the material world
