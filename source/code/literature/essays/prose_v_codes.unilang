􏱩its a noble idea on the surface, but at the neurological level the activities of coding/writing remain distinctly different and affect the brain bilaterally􏱪􏱟􏱠􏱧􏱨
􏱩writing and reading an essay (such as this) strongly evokes the left side of your brain in the regions canonically associated with language􏱪􏱟􏱠􏱧􏱨

􏱩More importantly, is it something we should fix or embrace?􏱪􏱟􏱠􏱧􏱨
􏱩how much should we continue to bend our artificial languages to make them look like natural languages, and is it dangerous to try?􏱪􏱟􏱠􏱧􏱨
