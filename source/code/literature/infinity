A Case for Finitism

Argument:
the entire enterprise of mathematics is foundationally broken because we've accidentally embedded religion into its core.
This religion I speak of is the imagination of a transcendental being who evades entropy to count to infinity.
Believing in this religion is necessary to assume that current mathematics will yield any truth about this reality.
There is a reasonable solution to the problem. It involves removing the use of infinity within the discipline.
Mathematics will no longer be specified as an infinite hierarchy of infinities.
The use of infinity will instead be characterized as recreational fantasies outside the discipline of mathematics itself.

This effort is essentially that of:

first we start with counting.  what does it mean to count?

Events <- Time
each increment is an event.  a sequence of events have a linear progression.  a linear progression requires the concept of time.
You cannot count without the progression of linear events.
Linear events is essentially how we conceptualize time.
Therefore, a precondition to counting is also the concept of time.

State <- Representation <- Space
From an "information theory" perspective,
each number needs representation.  whether its a single particle or atom, the neurons in your mind, the lead particles on a piece of paper, a bit inside a computer, or the vibrating sound waves of a spoken number.  
Also, a number is defined by its uniqueness to all other numbers.  Despite how a number is represented, the more numbers involved the more lower bounded space is needed.
A precondition to counting is representation.
A precondition to representation is the concept of space

Entropy
Entropy exists on any set of state.
Entropy is a measurement of possible configurations a system can be in.

Counting increases what?

Counting increases both state and events.
The more states needed the more representations needed.
The more representation needed the more space needed.
The more events needed time can only remain the same or increase.



Turing Machine - Invalid for this reality (We use a bounded turning machine
Euclidean Geometry - Invalid for this reality (We exist in non-euclidean spaces, or a bounded euclidean)
The Halting problem - Invalid for this reality (relies on a traditional turing machine)

Mathematical Paradoxes involving Infinities:
Cantor's proof of differently sized infinities - Invalid for this reality
infinity + 1 = infinity (invalid)
infinity - 1 = infinity (invalid)
infinity + infinity = infinity (invalid)
Anything involving Alph (N) (invalid)
Making room in a hotel
The barber shop paradox
Does the all encompassing set encompass itself (invalid)

Think of what paradox actually means.  An imaginary situation that cannot occur in reality


Specifications of Infinity:
 - Countable Infinity
 - Uncountable Infinity
 - Potential Infinity
