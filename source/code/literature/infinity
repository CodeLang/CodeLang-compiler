Argument:
the entire enterprise of mathematics is foundationally broken because we've accidentally embedded religion into its core.
there is a reasonable solution to the problem. It involves removing the use of infinity within the discipline.
Mathematics will no longer be specified as an infinite hierarchy of infinities.

first we start with counting.  what does it mean to count?

Events <- Time
each increment is an event.  a sequence of events have a linear progression.  a linear progression requires the concept of time.
You cannot count without the progression of linear events
Therefore, a precondition to counting is also the concept of time.

State <- Representation <- Space
each number needs representation.  whether its a single particle or atom, the neurons in your mind, the lead particles on a piece of paper, a bit inside a computer, or the vibrating sound waves of a spoken number.  
Also, a number is defined by its uniqueness to all other numbers.  Despite how a number is represented, the more numbers involved the more lower bounded space is needed.
A precondition to counting is representation.
A precondition to representation is the concept of space

Entropy
Entropy exists on any set of state.
Entropy is a measurement of possible configurations a system can be in.

Counting increases what?

Counting increases both state and events.
The more states needed the more representations needed.
The more representation needed the more space needed.
The more events needed time can only remain the same or increase.
