the entire enterprise of mathematics is foundationally broken because we've accidently embedded religion into its core.
there is a reasonable solution though.

first we start with counting.  what does it mean to count?

Time
each increment is an event.  a sequence of events have a linear progression.  a linear progression requires the concept of time.
A precondition to counting is time.

Space
each number needs representation.  whether its a single particle or atom, the neurons in your mind, the lead particles on a piece of paper, a bit in a computer, or the vibrating sound waves of a spoken number.  
Also, a number is defined by its uniqueness to all other numbers.  Despite how a number is represented, the more numbers involved the more lower bounded space is needed.
