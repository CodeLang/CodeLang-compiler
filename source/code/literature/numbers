If numbers exist, then where would we find them?
They cannot be seen or touched in our physical reality.
We see them only through signs, in which the signifier points to the unobtainable signified.
Where a photo could be an iconic sign to a physical signified, a number sign tends instead to be symbolic sign to an abstract object.  
But that's not to say numbers did not begin as icons.
In the case of tally marks the sign is the both the signifier and the signified of its own representation.  
A self-referential existence that instead indicates the accumulated events of counting.


scratch:
An existence outside our normal particle based experience.
yet they materialize within our minds as if originating from an abstract plain.
To exist as a concept alone, they are perhaps nothing more than a network of neurons.
The instantiation of a thought at times are signifiers to the signifieds of physical objects.
The existence of a number in the mind may be a mental surrogate of a physical object.



Could something exist without a spacial location?
