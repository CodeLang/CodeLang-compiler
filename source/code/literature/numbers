If numbers exist, then where would we find them?
They cannot be seen or touched from physical reality.
Signs of numbers exist, much like a portrait to a signified physical object.
An existence outside our normal particle based experience.
yet they materialize within our minds as if originating from an abstract plain.
To exist as a concept alone, they are perhaps nothing more than a network of neurons.
The instantiation of a thought at times are signifiers to the signifieds of physical objects.
The existence of a number in the mind may be a mental surrogate of a physical object.



Could something exist without a spacial location?

spatio-temporal realm
