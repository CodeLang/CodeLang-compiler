Numbers as Signs

If numbers exists, where do they exist?
They've always been out of grasp from our physical senses;
as if they've been granted some kind of nonterminating pre-existence beyond our spatio-temporal realm.
Do they exist outside our comprehension of them, or are numbers nothing more than a human construction?



[overview of the isms]
To address these epistemological issues we will first model numbers as signs.
//If humans weren't around, surely the concept of "number" would still be there waiting to be discovered.
As Plato would put it: "numbers are even beyond our heaven", in a realm deemed hyperuranion. 
Hyperuranion was his idea of a universe filled with perfect forms outside our universe.



known to us today as the Platonic realm.

A direct attack on Platonism would be a difficult effort due to its untestable claims.  Instead, we will develop a different approach of numbers first for comparison.

Interacting with numbers is done exclusively and indirectly through the use of signs; where in Saussurean terms, the signifier of the sign points to the unobtainable signified; the number itself.
Contrast that to a photograph in Peircean terms which operates as an iconic sign.  The photo sign signifier or the sign vehicle representation points to that which was or still is the actualized physical signified; the interpreted sense.
A number sign is however a symbolic sign in which the signified points to an abstract object; a mathematical object.

That is not to say that numbers can only exist as symbols.
In the case of the tally marks, the sign is both the signifier and the signified of its own representation.
A self-referential existence that exposes the accumulated events of it having been counted into existence.
The physical representation of an idealized iconic set of tallies is itself an indexical sign to the act of having been counted.
An evolution of semiotic signs for numbers are revealed where a conventionalized set of indexable events becomes itself the iconic representation of past events.
With increased familiarity on duplicated self-referencing signs, new foreign representations are introduced and the number becomes symbolic.
That is to say, a number's existence pre-assumes a temporal continuum which has been abstracted through symbolism.
If numbers exist anywhere, their existence spans the temporal continuum in which they had been counted.
Observing a number at any point in time would collapse its existence to an indexical sign where the signified representation is that of past events.
However one may be left with doubts that the time continum is a true precondition for numbers as one could simply express "1 million", knowing that neither you nor I have counted it.
At the symbolic level, the precondition of counting can be suspended as arithmetical laws can be applied to the language of symbols.  
Again, "one million plus one" is "one million and one" which can be validated without having done the counting.  I pose to you the following:  
What is 10^10^10^10 + 1 evaluated?  Symbolism falls short


Symbolic representations are of course a natural abstraction for scaling

To say that numbers are symbolic sign abstractions over self-referential iconic signs which in turn are indexical signs to sequential events we are then persuaded again to return to the spatio-temporal property that underpin a number's existence; the phenomenon of counting.


from ted talk:
Frege-Russel 2 = {{a1,a2},{b1,b2},{c1,c2},...}
von neumann 2 = {0,1}
Cantor = {A,B}


show that numbers are algoirthms not data
verbs not nouns
see the church encoding and the peano axioms (succ) and some set theory like union thing.  
They are all function calls which proves my point that they need time.

my stance: nominalism but not about our world.  about our imagined worlds



tallies = Unary numeral system = repunits

scratch:
An existence outside our normal particle based experience.
yet they materialize within our minds as if originating from an abstract plain.
To exist as a concept alone, they are perhaps nothing more than a network of neurons.
The instantiation of a thought at times are signifiers to the signifieds of physical objects.
The existence of a number in the mind may be a mental surrogate of a physical object.



Could something exist without a spacial location?

There are many universes and many of them are fictional.
Skeleton derived copied and manipulated, abstracted and simplified, emulated and simulated, created, tested, and destroyed.
