blast lit candle sticks on wooden spicks to sink wax below canyon cuts.

needles scrape and sneak in sounds of pry to bend muffled squeeks.
nail cutters dig between splicked covets of tight crooks.
stuck on bent closing. bent on retreat. tares over sharper.
pressed on burn where tightened pinches feel nervous
to sting depths higher once slid
