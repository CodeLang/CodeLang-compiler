there's clearly something bad swimming inside.  if I cut my temple to let some blood out maybe it will hurt less.

functions are little universes.  imaginary worlds much like the act of doing mathematics.  and what a joy it is to inject something into that universe and then extract something back out.
Sometimes universes bleed together via external state.
