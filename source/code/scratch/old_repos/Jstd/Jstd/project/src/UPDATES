+-------------------------+
| PROGRAM_OPTIONS CHANGES |
+-------------------------+
-Changed the "base_functions_only" flag to "all_functions"
    *exporting all of the functions is no longer the default [because you wouldn't want it to be]

-Changed all of the main tasks to be off by default
    *--no-scan becomes --scan
    *--no-export becomes --export
    *--no-build becomes --build
    *--no-documentation becomes --documentation
    *--no-stats becomes --stats

    *this means that if you just run the jstd-tool without any flags it will tell you "to run at least one of the tasks" mentioned above.

-changed the warn_amount infinity number to be -1 instead of zero (this lets me get rid of an extra variable in the warn_machine).

-colors in the command line, are now optional, but on by default

+-------------------------+
|       NEW CLASSES       |
+-------------------------+
-added some more objects to decompose the scan process easier
	*root_scanner (static non-constructible)
	*subfolder_scanner (static non-constructible)
	*compact_directory_scanner (static non-constructible)
	    *compact_scanner (static non-constructible)
	*expression_directory_scanner(static non-constructible)
	    *expression_scanner(static non-constructible)
	*header_scanner (static non-constructible)
	*code_scanner (static non-constructible)
	*info_scanner (static non-constructible)
	*warn_fixer (static non-constructible)
	*warn_fix_prompter (static  non-constructible)
	*compact_problem (enum class)
	
	*Edited warn_machine object to hold a warn_log object
	
	*THERE ARE SOME OTHER CLASSES, I ADDED TOO. LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTATION

+-------------------------+
|      OTHER CHANGES      |
+-------------------------+
- More renaming and restructuring of the pseudo library
    *each directory now has an info file that as of right now specifies what the directory is.
    for example: root, function root, type category, type, behaviour category

- Percentages shown during the scan, export, and build processes

- Finished Dependency Checker
    *python is no longer a dependency
    
-Added a documentation folder at the root of the repository, for those interested in the code base, and willing to help(also for my own benefit).
    *built a diagram to show object relationship for the Jstd-tool.
    *built diagram to show the layout of functions in the Jstd Library

-put a little note in the last_time_ran file so if anyone opens it, they have an idea of what it is there for.

-I built a little twitter thing to post new releases.  It's not a part of the user code-base, but you can now follow new updates at @jstd_releases
