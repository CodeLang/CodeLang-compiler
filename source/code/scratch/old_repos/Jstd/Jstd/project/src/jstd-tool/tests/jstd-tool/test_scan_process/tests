Here are some automatic tests on the Scanner portion of the Jstd-Tool,
that we would like to be run on the code base.  It will make sure that changes in the code base doesn't introduce bugs.

Self Tested / Program To Test It

[prompted/unprompted]

[ | ] [ | ] Missing File On Root
[ | ] [ | ] Uneeded File On Root

[ | ] [ | ] Missing File In Sub-directory
[ | ] [ | ] Uneeded File In Sub-directory

[ | ] [ | ] Duplicate Compact Entry
[ | ] [ | ] Empty Compact Entry

[ | ] [ | ] Miscased Folder(lowercased or contains spaces) (basically, try to convert the folder, and if the new string is different, then there is a problem with the original)

[ | ] [ | ] Unidentified Decomposition Type
[ | ] [ | ] Missing Decomposition Type

[ | ] [ | ] Make sure changing a folder name happens last, since all of the other warnings record the miscased folder in the log

[ | ] [ | ] Whitespace at the end
[ | ] [ | ] Consecutive Whitespace in the middle
[ | ] [ | ] Contains capital letters
[ | ] [ | ] Contains invalid characters

Un-Implemented:
[ | ] 0-1 entry compact file
