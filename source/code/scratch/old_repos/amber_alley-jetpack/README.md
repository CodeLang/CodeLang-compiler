Amber Alley - Jetpack
===================

```

This is a true story.

I got my jetpack
oh yea, my jetpack
I'm going up again
where I can't see this land
I'm heading through the clouds
And I ain't coming down
pack weighs 140 pounds
God's laughing at me now
'Cause I am out of gas
I'm heading down real fast
Good thing my ship's equipped
I pull that cord and flipped

I got my parachute
oh yeah, my parachute
And now I'm floating down
hoping I land on ground
But then I start to see
there's water under me
Well ain't this just the worst
Jetpack feels like a hearse

Oh, woe is me.
Let's break out that plan C, oh shall we?
OK, just, let me get this right
Read it, Grab it, Hold on tight!
it 'cause she maybe uses awful taste, tryin' to vice (advice?)

Locate that Velcro strip
Rip it free and hold your grip
On impact will inflate
Thank you! And have a nice day!
(Gasp, Gasp, SPLASH!)

I got my floaty boat
Oh yeah, my floaty boat
And two little teeny tiny oars, to row with
Where I'm headed I don't know
All I'm sayin' is let it hold
I'm looking at god to say
"Ain't there some kind of escape?"
Is this what I get?
For taking a short-cut?
Oh, but I start to see 
the pain in his eyes, he looks at me


Refrain:
oh woah oh woah
You know know it's hard sometimes when I look down
No I don't have no wings, no
I was meant to keep both my feet on the ground
Keep my feet on the ground

I got the ocean sky
Oh yeah, the ocean sky
I know but then I sigh
It's not my time to die
I didn't even see my life 
flash in front of my eyes
Well If I'll be alright
Then I'll just float this right
Just then, the water ripples
A natural my sweat trickles
Inside this giant wave
I mean this super massive wave

I have a visitor
Oh yeah, a visitor
He's like a gagillion pounds
All scaley up and down
And I'm like, "What are you going to eat me now?"
He just looks and smiles at me
All the sudden everythings heavy
Head just feels light and feathery
But before I can start to drift
I'm heading down, but I'm lifted

Refrain:
Out oh out oh oh
You know know it's hard sometimes when I look down
No I don't have no wings, no
I was meant to keep both my feet on["off" in other performances] the ground
Keep my feet on the ground

And he says:
"Hiya kid you look like your having a blast
Here ya go, you need some gas?
By the way, that's a sweet jetpack
What else you got in that?
It looks [kinda] like a death trap
[but you know what, I'd also suggest a map] or [Also, might I suggest a map]
At this point I'm quite speechless
And the air, it tastes like peaches

He says:
"uh uh now, not so fast
I got you here at last
And I'll help you all I ask is this
Just for one tiny kiss"

Refrain:
Oh no oh no
You know know it's hard sometimes when I look down
No I don't have no wings, no
I was meant to keep both my feet on["off" in other performances] the ground
Keep my feet on the ground

Well I got my jetpack back
Oh yeah, my jetpack back
And I don't want to roam
This time I'm going home
And when I get to earth
I'm gonna kiss that dirt
I'm gonna kiss the sky now
Thank god that I'm alive now
And when I'm on the ground
pack weighs only 15 pounds
I'm liking this here land
I'm liking where I stand


Refrian:
Woah oh oh woah
You know know it's hard sometimes when I look down
Well I don't have no wings, no
I was meant to keep both my feet on the ground
Keep my feet on the ground
