- does not work on strings yet
- better name for this repo?
- better tests
- clean parts up
  (looking forward to concepts / static if)
- should I inline everything?  Do I need to forward(&&) any other arguments?
- speed tests (tuple / pair creation. function call overhead?)
  I don't care about the compile time

- a version that doesn't iterate over containers

- iteration order? left to right or right to left
  and if both iterable, do we iterate over the left before the right or vice versa
