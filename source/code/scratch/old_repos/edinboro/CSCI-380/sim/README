CSCI 380
Program 1

PROGRAM SUMMARY:
This is a simulation of an operating system called SIM.  The core execution of 
the program simulates the booting of a machine.  The boot begins the operating 
system called SIM.  The SIM runs program files of it's own language.  The SIM 
handles the communication between the memory and the cpu.  The memory is made up 
of instructions, and the instructions are made up of an OP code and an address.
The cpu is made up of the necessary registers and components needed for comput-
ation and program execution.  The processor sends signals to and from the SIM.  
This way, the SIM can request and send operations to and from memory on the 
CPU's behalf.

BUILDING:
run "make" where you are now, and the executable will appear in this directory.
program files are here on the root also.  If you run the program without param-
eters, it will prompt for a file.  You may also pass in file names through the
command line.
ex. "./sim p1a.mlp p1b.mlp p1c.mlp p1d.mlp"
will run all 4 programs and exit.

TO DO:
Interupts?? :)
