###first real day techniqually

####4 Major programming paradigms:
    - Imperative
    - Object Oriented
    - functional
    - logic
    *lots others, but those are the kind we'll look at
    *he had scripting on the syllaus so I assume he mean imperative for that

####some examples:
C - Imperative  
SmallTalk - Object Oriented  
C++ - Imperative with object oriented  
scheme - primarily functional  
prolog - logic  

####objectives more or less
1.  
    - syntax / semantics using formal methods  
    - parsing algorithms  
    
2. 
    - name conventions and how bindings are implemented.  
I'm not sure what bindings mean in this context.  Probably binding an identifer to the actual data.  Or it could possibly be the binding of one language to another; like calling C code from a Java program.
    - why data structures?
    - control models
    - abstract data types
    - object-oriented programming
    - concurrent programming
    - program exceptions and events.

3. 
    -play with other languages
        -scheme
        -prolog

ha, meyer is so cute
