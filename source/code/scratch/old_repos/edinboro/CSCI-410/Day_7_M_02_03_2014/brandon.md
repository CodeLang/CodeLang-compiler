+2 Days Ch 4

```
   It's been seven days I've been trapped in this class. Nothing to eat, nothing to drink. I am so tired,
   but I must stay awake, stay focused or I will never make it out of here.
```
```
   There are others here too, I am not the only one. They struggle like me to make it through, to see
   the other side. Before us there stands a sage dispensing knowledge from a time long gone by. He speaks
   in strange arcane words.
```
```
   There is no clock in here, no windows. There is no way to know how much time has gone by. With no way to
   track the time, no way to measure progress toward my release time seems to stand still. The seconds seem
   to streach on for eternity.
```
