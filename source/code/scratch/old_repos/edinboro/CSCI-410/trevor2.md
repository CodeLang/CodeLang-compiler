 - python is typeless
 - binding (static/dynamic)
 - using static in c++
 - storage binding and lifetime
 - stack/heap
 - scope
 - APL (a programming language) - all variables are allocated on the heap  
 ------------------------------------------------------  
2/14/2014:  
 - scope and life time
 - comma operator in c++ and java

scope - range of which the thing is visible  
life time - time that a name is bound to something  
a static variable in a function is a good way to see the difference between the two  

can you access a static var from outside a function if you scope to it? or if you shadow a var with brackets, can you scope a level up to reach the other var?
 ------------------------------------------------------  
 2/17/2014:  
  - went over homework on advantages and disadvantages of static vs dynamic typing  
  - looked at AGOL  
  - "we need to talk about arrays a little bit"  
  - "we should know what assositve arrays are"  
  - "we should knoow what "User-Defined Ordinal Types"  
 
we just talked about fundamental types like 'chars' and 'decimals'  
 
 ------------------------------------------------------  
 2/19/2014:  
run the program gsi for scheme  
`(exit)` is how you quit the interpreter  
talked about character strings, arrays
coerce or cast to an integer type?  
 ------------------------------------------------------  
2/21/2014:  
lambdas are functions without names. for example  
```Î»x x+x```  
looked at scheme in gsi today  
 ------------------------------------------------------  
2/24/2014:  
looked more at scheme. program now assigned.
