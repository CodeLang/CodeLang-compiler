<p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the rating system work?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> I always rate something to be something out of something. Hopefully the ratio is representable as a decimal, otherwise the database will label it priceless.  <a href="{{ site.url }}/scores">Here is a page</a> on the site where you can see all the ratings so far.</p>
