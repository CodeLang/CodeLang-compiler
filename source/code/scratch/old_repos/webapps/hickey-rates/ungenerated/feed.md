 <p>All you kids with your phones and your txting; I bet you don’t even know what an RSS feed is!  It’s fine; I have a better idea.  I’ll have a bot text you when there are new posts. If you still want an rss feed, <a href="{{ site.url }}/feed.xml">here you go</a>.</p>

<p>BASICALLY, don’t worry about a thing!
<strong>HickeyRatesThings@gmail.com</strong> will send you a bi-monthly text (assuming there are updates)  </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I don’t care about this!<br />
<strong>A:</strong> txt <strong>‘off’</strong> to <strong>HickeyRatesThings@gmail.com</strong><br />
*This will unsubscribe you.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I got something you should take a look&nbsp;at!<br />
<strong>A:</strong> None of these are questions haha.  Ok, anything that isn’t a command sent to that email, I’ll personally take a look at- and then probably review.   </p>
