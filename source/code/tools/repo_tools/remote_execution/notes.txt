REAPI meeting (10/13/2020): 
mostly questions & implementations about v3 (we are on v2)
bytestream compression: should the client's offset point to compressed/uncompressed data?
many opinions; no resolution. throw away bytestream in the future for better semantics?
platforms: let's move them from the command to the action instead; it will save a blob download.
Platforms are also getting too big.  A different format might be needed in v3.
reapi protobuf: many tickets on build issues. particularly go bindings.
should we commit the go bindings pre-generated, or drop support? drop.
reapi CI: There is still no CI.  someone should add that.
bazelcon: no remex talks this year.
