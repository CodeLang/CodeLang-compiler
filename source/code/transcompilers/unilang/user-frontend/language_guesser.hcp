//if you didn't provide which languages/artifacts to go to, that's fine.
//we'll figure out based on some kind of context.
//this way we can run a single shell command that does everything,
//without having to worry about about any complicated cli, or big config files.  
//don't get me wrong, you can still override all the default deduction through those other methods.
//but usually I'm not jumping around to too many repos, so I can just specify a context and allow these helpful deductions.

//TODO(thickey): pretty much all the languages this impl chooses,
//is based on the context of the company/repo I'm working in.
//we need configs for that context.  context being like company_name or something.
//we can probably leverage or mirror the --exporter property.

//TODO(thickey): we may want to do a language bundle pack.  
//i.e. cpp,cpp_test,cpp_benchmark, etc are all in the cpp_full_pack.

//TODO(thickey): these languages strings should be enums
//same with --exporter.
