BDF is a bitmap font format.  
Its kind of old and most people prefer raster fonts.  
However, I found its simplicity nice for pixel perfect renderings of new and novel glyphs.  
Unilang has its own font, and its rendered in BDF.  
Unilang has an IDE which also reads and renders BDF text directly on its canvas.
This code however should be generic enough to work with BDFs in general.
