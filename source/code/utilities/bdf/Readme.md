BDF is a bitmap font format.  
I've found its simplicity nice for pixel perfect renderings of new and novel glyphs.  
Unilang has its own font, and its rendered in BDF.  
We specify the BDF font with a data structure representation.  
This allows us to generate font files, or render the pixels directly in other applications.
