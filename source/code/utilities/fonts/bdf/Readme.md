BDF is a bitmap font format.  
I've found its simplicity nice for pixel perfect renderings of glyphs.
Since its a pixel defined font, it is easy to create new and novel glyphs.  
Unilang has its own font, and its rendered in BDF.  
We specify the BDF font with a data structure representation.  
This allows us to generate font files, or render the pixels directly in other applications.
