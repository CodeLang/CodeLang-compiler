    //and then you have just a black screen and you have to restart the machine.
    //I don't even know if the application ends up exiting and my OS just never recovers.
    //But I can't even go to a different ubuntu session.  I couldn't figure out anything but
    //restarting the machine.  Not good.  Probably the best thing to do, is go with the desktop mode for now.

    //avoid graphics tearing
    //Sometimes, when your application runs fast, you may notice visual artifacts such as tearing.
    //The reason is that your application's refresh rate is not synchronized with the vertical frequency of the monitor,
    //and as a result, the bottom of the previous frame is mixed with the top of the next one.
    //The solution to this problem is to activate vertical synchronization.
    //It is automatically handled by the graphics card,
    //and can easily be switched on and off with the setVerticalSyncEnabled function.
    //After this call, your application will run at the same frequency as the monitor's refresh rate.
    //Sometimes setVerticalSyncEnabled will have no effect:
    //this is most likely because vertical synchronization is forced to "off" in your graphics driver's settings.
    //It should be set to "controlled by application" instead.
    window->setVerticalSyncEnabled(true);
    
    //WARNING: setVerticalSync and set FrameLimit SHOULD NOT be mixed.
    //window->setFramerateLimit(60);
