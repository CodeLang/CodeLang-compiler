# bazel_wrapper is a bootrapping bazel with no extra strings attached.
# This script provides a few extra (and necessary) flags.  
# Ideally, I would like calling bazel_wrapper directly to work when building the whole repo.
# The goal would be to have this script vall bazel_wrapper directly with no extra flags.
# Until I figure out how to set the correct default flags, there may be some extra flags
# automatically added here  

# toolchains to try:
# --crosstool_top=@co_vsco_bazel_toolchains//tools/cpp:default-toolchain
# --crosstool_top=@llvm_toolchain//:toolchain

# quiet vs loud on errors:
# --verbose_failures
